    "Regarding the decision making & movement process of the walker; we shall follow some simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The walker will consider the 3 cells infront of it; and weight them based on the concentration\n",
    "    1. Invalid moves (such as leaving the grid area, or into a wall) are given a zero weight\n",
    "    2. If all three moves are invalid, the walker will turn all the way around and wait until next turn to move.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each weight, we apply an exponent (`wander_exponent`) which controls how random or deterministic the walker is when picking from valid moves\n",
    "    1. This is shown in an interactible format here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dqls0azfzl\n",
    "    2. An exponent value of 0 means that all options have equal chance, regardless of concentration\n",
    "    3. Higher values increase the influence of concentration where an infinite value would mean fully deterministic decision making\n",
    "    4. Negative values make it run away from the marker\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once a decision has been made, the walker will store its new position and orientation; and all walkers will commit to their new state at the same time.\n",
    "    1. This isnt very useful now, but is useful once we start introducing the action of depositing markers here during this process.\n",
